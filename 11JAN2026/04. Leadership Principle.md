This revision guide is tailored for the **Amazon Data Engineer I (L4)** phone screening, focusing on the specific Leadership Principles (LPs) and expectations for early-career professionals.

---

### 1. The L4 Mindset: "The Individual Contributor"
At the L4 level, Amazon is not looking for a manager; they are looking for a **reliable, curious, and technically sound owner**.
*   **Focus:** Individual contribution, peer collaboration, and growth potential.
*   **Key Traits:** Can you ramp up quickly? Do you own your mistakes? Can you explain the "why" behind your code?

### 2. Core LPs for L4 Data Engineers

| Principle | DE Focus (The "L4 Version") | Key Subtopics for Stories |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Obsession** | Serving downstream users (BIEs, Data Scientists, PMs). | Clarifying vague requirements; fixing data latency for a dashboard. |
| **Ownership** | Treating the pipeline/code as your own; no "not my job." | Fixing a legacy bug; staying late to recover a failed production job. |
| **Learn & Be Curious** | Rapidly mastering the AWS stack or new languages. | Self-teaching Spark/Redshift; asking about business logic, not just SQL. |
| **Bias for Action** | Speed and "Two-Way Door" (reversible) decisions. | Fixing a data discrepancy immediately; making a choice with 70% data. |
| **Dive Deep** | Finding the "Root Cause" of data issues. | Complex debugging; query optimization (refactoring slow SQL). |

### 3. Detailed LP Revision Notes

#### **Customer Obsession (Focus: Data Consumers)**
*   **Scenario 1: Identifying Needs.** A time you paused a build because the stakeholder's request didn't match the end goal.
    *   *Check:* Did you ask what metrics they actually needed to move the needle?
*   **Scenario 2: Solving Pain Points.** Fixing a "flaky" pipeline that caused a Business Intelligence Engineer to lose trust in the data.

#### **Ownership (Focus: Accountability)**
*   **The "Not My Job" Test:** Never say "I waited for the DBA." Instead: "I investigated the logs myself."
*   **Beyond the Minimum:** Writing documentation for a process that was previously undocumented, helping the whole team on-board faster.

#### **Learn and Be Curious (Focus: Rapid Acquisition)**
*   **The Weekend Warrior:** Describe a time you didn't know a service (e.g., AWS Glue or Lambda) and learned it under pressure to unblock a project.
*   **The "Why":** Don't just pull data. Demonstrate you understand how that data affects the business's bottom line.

#### **Bias for Action (Focus: Timely Decisions)**
*   **Proactive Fixing:** You saw a data quality trend sliding and implemented a validation check before it broke the downstream report.
*   **Limited Info:** Making a technical choice (e.g., which partition key to use) when your senior engineer was OOO to keep the sprint on track.

#### **Dive Deep (Focus: Root Cause)**
*   **The "5 Whys":** Don't just say "the job failed." Say: "The job failed because of an OOM error $\rightarrow$ caused by a data skew in the join key $\rightarrow$ which I solved by using a salted key."
*   **Performance Tuning:** Specifically mention *how* you optimized (e.g., "I reduced a 2-hour runtime to 15 minutes by implementing columnar storage and pruning partitions").

### 4. Modified Expectations for L4 Candidates

| Principle | L4 Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Earn Trust** | Admitting you broke a pipeline and documenting the "Post-Mortem" so others don't repeat it. |
| **Deliver Results** | How you handled a heavy course load + internship or a sudden shift in project priority. |
| **Hire & Develop** | Helping a fellow intern debug their Python script or creating a "SQL Best Practices" doc. |
| **Think Big** | Moving from a manual CSV upload to a small automated Python crawler/ETL. |

### 5. STAR Method: The L4 "Cheat Sheet"

Amazon interviewers evaluate the **Action (A)** and **Result (R)** most heavily.

*   **S/T (Situation/Task) - 15%:** Provide context. (e.g., "Our daily sales report was lagging by 4 hours.")
*   **Action - 60%:** Use **"I"**, not "We." 
    *   *Bad:* "We decided to fix the SQL."
    *   *Good:* "I analyzed the execution plan, identified a Cartesian product, and refactored the join to use a temporary table."
*   **Result - 25%:** Must be **Quantifiable**.
    *   *Bad:* "The stakeholders were happy and the data was faster."
    *   *Good:* "Reduced pipeline latency by **30%**, saving **5 hours** of engineering manual work per week and reducing AWS costs by **$200/month**."

### 6. Preparation Checklist
*   [ ] **6-8 Stories:** Prepare 6-8 core stories that can be adapted to multiple LPs.
*   [ ] **Technical Drill-down:** For every story, be ready to explain the architecture (e.g., "Why did you choose S3 over DynamoDB?").
*   [ ] **Valid Sources:** It's okay to use Internships, Capstone projects, or even complex personal GitHub projects.
*   [ ] **The "Fail" Story:** Have at least one story where you messed up, took ownership, and learned from it (Earns Trust).
